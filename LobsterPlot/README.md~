Python script to calculate different forms of neutrino masses 


# Calculating and plotting neutrino masses

### Effective Majorana mass is defined as: 
$m_{\beta\beta} = |\Sigma_i U^2_{ei} M_i|$

### Kinetic neutrino mass from beta decay: 
$m_\beta^2 = \Sigma_i|U_{ei}|^2 M^2_i $

where the mixing matrix elements are: 
* $U_{e1} = cos(\theta_{12})cos(\theta_{13})$, 
* $U_{e2} = sin(\theta_{12})cos(\theta_{13})e^{i\alpha}$,
* $U_{e3} = sin(\theta_{13})e^{i(\beta-\eta)}$

$\alpha$, $\beta$ are two Majorana mixing angles, $\eta$ is the CP-violating angle. In the calculation, $\beta-\eta$ is one random number from 0 to 2$\pi$.

## Mixing Parameters from PDG2014

## If we include sterile neutrinos
* $U_{e4} = sin(\theta_{14})e^{i\gamma}$

$\gamma$ is an additinal Majorana mixing angle.

The mixing parameters for the 3+1 model is taken from Kopp, et al (http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3011). We should keep in mind:
* No 3$\sigma$ fit parameters were given in the reference. Only best-fit values are used for this calculation.
* The added sterile flavor has little impact on mixing parameters of the standard 3 flavor values. I keep using the PDG2014 values with the ad hoc sterile part (partly to avoid adding yet another set of numbers)
